# InstallingHyperion

I have a new system with these specs:

Also a Samsung 240 gB SATA SSD card for the OS.

The installation of CUDA and tensorflow on this very new machine was not trivial, 
so I have assembled the code that I used to install cuda/tensorflow and keras (from tensorflow and cuda website, borrowing from github as well as stackoverflow solutions as wel as other online sources, i am sorry I don't have all the references anymore,it was hectic, but sure I love the www!!!).

One extra tip, make sure all the (right) software you need or want to use is in the environment that tensorflow is in!

Best,

Hanneke
